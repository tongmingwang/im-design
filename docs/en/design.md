# Design Principles

ImDesign philosophy: Single Responsibility, Extensibility, Maintainability, Customizability, Motion Effects, Ultimate Experience.

## Single Responsibility Principle

A component should do one thing and do it well.

## Extensibility

Components should be easily extended or modified to accommodate different requirements.

For example: By using slots and props, developers can add new functionality or styles to components without modifying existing code.

## Maintainability

Code should be easy to understand, modify and maintain.

For example: Following consistent naming conventions, writing clear comments, and keeping components at a reasonable size can improve maintainability.

## Customizability

Styles should be easily customizable to meet specific design requirements.

For example: Using CSS variables allows developers to define multiple style options and let users choose and apply their preferred styles.

When designing components, we should always keep these principles in mind to ensure we create high-quality, flexible and easy-to-use UI elements.

## Motion Effects

Motion effects enhance user experience by making interfaces more dynamic and engaging.

For example: Using CSS animations or JavaScript to implement smooth transitions, hover effects, etc.

## Ultimate Experience

Beyond basic functionality, we strive to provide the best possible user interaction experience.

For example: Considering user habits and psychological expectations to optimize component behavior and performance, making it more intuitive and easier to operate.

Throughout the design process, we continuously pursue these goals to ensure our product delivers the best visual and interactive experience for users.
